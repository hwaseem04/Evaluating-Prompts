This means no matter how the truth values are assigned to the individual propositions that make up the formula, the overall formula will always evaluate to true. In essence, a tautology is universally true.\n\n   **Example of a Tautology:** \n   \\( p \\vee \\neg p \\)  \n   This is a tautology because no matter what truth value is assigned to \\( p \\), \\( p \\) or \\( \\neg p \\) (not \\( p \\)) will always be true. If \\( p \\) is true, then \\( p \\vee \\neg p \\) simplifies to true or false, which is true. If \\( p \\) is false, then \\( p \\vee \\neg p \\) simplifies to false or true, which is again true.\n\n2. **Contradiction:** A contradiction, or a logically contradictory proposition, is a formula that is false under every possible valuation of its propositional variables. That means, irrespective of the truth values assigned to the components of the formula, it will always evaluate to false.

Two propositions are logically equivalent if, when formatted as a biconditional (if and only if) statement, the resulting compound statement is a tautology, meaning it is true in every possible situation.\n\nSymbolically, two propositions, P and Q, are logically equivalent if P \u2194 Q is a tautology. The equivalence can also be established through truth tables; if P and Q always yield the same truth value under all possible combinations of truth values of their variables, they are said to be logically equivalent. This relation is generally denoted as P \u2261 Q.\n\n**Example of Logically Equivalent Propositions:**\n\nAn example of two logically equivalent propositions is the law of double negation. This law states that a proposition P and the negation of the negation of P (\u00ac\u00acP) are logically equivalent. In simpler terms, stating something and then stating that it is not untrue are essentially the same. \n\nFor instance, consider the proposition P: \"It is raining.\" The proposition \u00ac\u00acP would then be: \"It is not true that it is not raining.\" According to the law of double negation, these two propositions are logically equivalent:\n\nP \u2261 \u00ac\u00acP\n\nA truth table can be used to verify this:\n- When P is true, \u00acP (not P) is false, and consequently, \u00ac\u00acP (not not P) is true.\n- When P is false, \u00acP is true, and therefore \u00ac\u00acP is false.\n\nSince the truth values of P and \u00ac\u00acP match in all possible cases, the two propositions are logically equivalent."

Therefore, we focus on scenarios in which both \"P \u2192 Q\" and \"P\" hold.\n- Notice that whenever P is true, look at the rows where P is True (T):\n  - First row: P is T, Q is T, thus, P \u2192 Q is T.\n  - Second row: P is T, Q is F, thus, P \u2192 Q is F.\n  - In the second row, even though P is true, P \u2192 Q is false, violating one of our premises. Therefore, this row does not satisfy the condition of both premises being true.\n  \n**Step 5: Validating the Argument**:\n- We are only interested in valid rows where both premises are true. This occurs in the first row, where P \u2192 Q is T (P is T, and Q is T).\n- In this row, Q is indeed true, thereby agreeing with our conclusion.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- This truth table shows that in every possible scenario where both premises \"If P, then Q\" and \"P\" are true, the conclusion \"Q\" is also true. \n- Thus, the argument \"If P, then Q. P. Therefore, Q.\" is valid.\n"

It serves as a way to simplify and solve logical expressions to determine the truth-value of a proposition under specific conditions.\n\n**Concept of Resolution in Propositional Logic:**\nResolution in propositional logic involves the use of a principle that simplifies complex logical expressions by eliminating redundancies. It was first introduced by John Alan Robinson in 1965. The basic idea revolves around the notion of resolving two clauses \u2013 essentially disjunctions of literals (where a literal is either a proposition or its negation) \u2013 that contain complementary literals (one literal and its negation).\n\nA simple example involves two clauses: \n1. \\( A \\lor B \\)\n2. \\( \\neg B \\lor C \\)\n\nHere, the literal \\( B \\) in the first clause and \\( \\neg B \\) in the second are complements. According to the resolution principle, because \\( B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\) can't both be true, one of \\( A \\) or \\( C \\) must be true if \\( B \\) or \\( \\neg B \\) are false (which they must be to satisfy both clauses). Hence, by resolving on \\( B \\), we derive the new clause \\( A \\lor C \\). This process of resolution reduces the problem size and is repeated in an attempt to find a contradiction or derive a tautology.\n\n**Role in Automated Theorem Proving:**\nAutomated theorem proving systems harness the power of resolution as a fundamental technique for validating theorems. The resolution rule, especially in its more general form which applies to first-order logic, enables algorithms to mechanically check the validity of logical statements by attempting to derive a contradiction from the negated form of the theorem to be proved. If the system can derive a contradiction (i.e., an empty clause), then the theorem is valid.\n\n1. **Formulating the Problem**: In automated theorem proving, one typically begins by expressing the problem as a set of axioms (propositions taken as given) and the negation of the theorem to be proven.\n\n2. **Applying Resolution**: Resolution is applied systematically to these axioms and negations to produce new clauses. These newly derived clauses are further resolved with each other or with existing clauses. This step is repeated, and throughout the iterative process, the set of clauses ideally is reduced.\n\n3. **Reaching a Conclusion**: If through this process, an empty clause (a contradiction) is derived, it confirms that the original theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms; it's proved (reflecting consistency among axioms and theorem). If the empty clause cannot be derived, and all resolution possibilities are exhausted, the theorem might not be provable given the current axioms or may require additional information or different axiomatic structuring.\n\nThe resolution method is vital in automated theorem proving because it provides a systematic and relatively straightforward mechanical procedure for testing the validity of logics under formalistic constraints, making it exceptionally powerful for applications needing rigour and precision such as in verifying the correctness of computer software and hardware designs."

It describes a property or relation that connects variables to terms, thereby establishing a specific condition or characteristic attributed to the subject or subjects. Predicates are essentially expressions that can be made into propositions when all variables are replaced by specific values. In simpler terms, a predicate is like a sentence with a blank to be filled in.\n\n   **Example of a Predicate**: Let \"P(x)\" be a predicate where \"P\" stands for \"is a prime number\". Here, \"x\" is a variable that can be substituted by any integer. The truth of \"P(x)\" depends on the integer that replaces \"x\". If \"x\" is replaced by 2, the predicate becomes \"2 is a prime number\", which is true.\n\n2. **Proposition**: A proposition, on the other hand, is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both. This is a complete statement with a definite truth value. Propositions are often the results of filling in the blanks left by predicates or are simply statements that express a complete idea without requiring further information to determine their truthfulness.\n\n   **Example of a Proposition**: \"The Earth is round.\" This statement is a proposition because it declares a specific claim about the Earth, which can be evaluated as either true or false based on factual evidence.\n\nThus, while predicates form the structural or functional components of propositions by specifying conditions or relations, propositions are the finalized, truth-valuable statements formed when predicates are fully specified or when standalone claims are made."

This technique is famously employed in the context of transforming logical statements into a form that is more suitable for automated theorem proving and other logic-based inquiries. \n\nTo understand Skolemization, one first needs to grasp the basic structure of predicate logic, which involves the use of quantifiers. There are two primary types of quantifiers: the universal quantifier (\u2200), which denotes \"for all\"; and the existential quantifier (\u2203), which denotes \"there exists\". \n\nThe purpose of Skolemization is to convert a formula into an equivalent formula that is free of existential quantifiers, hence simplifying the structure of the formula. To achieve this, the method involves replacing each existential quantifier with a Skolem function. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it operates:\n\n1. **Identify the Existential Quantifiers**: Consider a formula in predicate logic that includes at least one existential quantifier, for example: \u2200x \u2203y P(x,y).\n\n2. **Replace with Skolem Functions**: Each existential quantifier is replaced with a Skolem function. The arity (number of arguments) of the Skolem function depends on the universal quantifiers that directly precede it. In the example above, the existential quantifier \u2203y can be replaced with a Skolem function f(x) which depends on x, resulting in the formula \u2200x P(x,f(x)).\n\n3. **Dependency on Universal Quantifiers**: The crucial aspect of the Skolem function is that it might depend on the variables bound by universal quantifiers that are in its scope. In the example, y is replaced by f(x) because y is existentially quantified within the scope of a universal quantifier over x.\n\nThe final Skolemized formula, like \u2200x P(x,f(x)), is equisatisfiable to the original formula but not necessarily logically equivalent. Equisatisfiability here means that if the original formula has a model (an interpretation under which it is true), then the Skolemized formula also has a model, and vice versa, though the interpretations ensuring truth may differ.\n\nBy replacing existential quantifiers with functions, Skolemization removes the indeterminacy that existential quantifiers introduce, making the logical structure easier to handle, especially for algorithms designed for automated theorem proving, resolution methods, and other forms of logical analysis. This transformation allows computers and mathematicians to work within a purely universal quantification framework, which is logically simpler to manage and typically more computationally feasible to process."

To translate this formula into prenex normal form, we first need to perform any necessary operations to bring all the quantifiers to the front of the formula, while ensuring the logical structure of the formula remains intact.\n\nIn predicate logic, implications can be expressed using disjunctions: \\( A \u2192 B \\) is logically equivalent to \\( \\neg A \\lor B \\). Applying this to the inner formula:\n- \\( P(x, y) \u2192 Q(y) \\) is equivalent to \\( \\neg P(x, y) \\lor Q(y) \\).\n\nThe given formula then becomes:\n- \u2203x \u2200y (\\(\\neg P(x, y) \\lor Q(y)\\)).\n\nSince quantifiers already appear at the front of the formula, and the inner formula only consists of a disjunction which doesn't affect the quantifiers' scope, the formula is already in prenex normal form.

Named after French mathematician Jacques Herbrand, this theorem provides a crucial basis for understanding and establishing the validity of logical sentences.\n\n### Concept of Herbrand\u2019s Theorem\n\nTo understand Herbrand\u2019s theorem, it helps to first be aware of how it relates to the concept of a Herbrand universe and Herbrand base. The Herbrand universe of a first-order theory is essentially the set of all ground (variable-free) terms that can be constructed from the constant symbols and function symbols in the theory. If the theory includes no constant symbols, an arbitrary one is added to ensure that the universe is non-empty. The Herbrand base comprises all possible ground atomic formulas constructed using predicate symbols and terms from the Herbrand universe.\n\nHerbrand's theorem states that a quantifier-free first-order formula (one without existential or universal quantifiers) is universally valid if and only if all possible interpretations or ground instances of the formula in its Herbrand base are true. In more practical terms, for universally quantified formulas, the theorem asserts that such a formula is valid if and only if there is a finite set of its ground instances that is unsatisfiable (provably false under all interpretations).\n\n### Implications for Automated Theorem Proving\n\n**1. Reduction of Problem Space:** Herbrand\u2019s theorem is significant in automated theorem proving because it allows for the reduction of the problem of proving the validity of a statement in first-order logic to a problem in propositional logic. By considering only the ground instances of formulas, it circumvents the need to consider infinitely many interpretations that first-order logic might otherwise require.\n\n**2. Basis for Algorithms:** Many automated theorem proving algorithms, like resolution-based provers, are based on principles laid out by Herbrand's theorem. These algorithms often work by effectively attempting to construct a Herbrand model or by refuting the existence of such a model through contradiction, exploring the space of possible interpretations in a systematic way.\n\n**3. Limitations and Challenges:** While theoretically powerful, the practical application of Herbrand\u2019s theorem points out the challenges in automated theorem proving, principally the explosion of terms in the Herbrand universe and base, especially with increasing formula complexity or with formulas that include function symbols, leading to what's known as the combinatorial explosion problem.\n\n**4. Evolution of Techniques:** Herbrand\u2019s work has inspired the development of more sophisticated techniques in theorem proving that incorporate optimizations to handle the complexity, such as term indexing, subsumption, and advanced unification techniques.\n\nIn summary, Herbrand's theorem provides a fundamental method for transferring the problem of theorem proving in first-order logic to a potentially more manageable form. It serves as a cornerstone for many logical reasoning tools and has profoundly influenced the field of automated theorem proving, leading to a deeper understanding of logical inference and the development of efficient computational tools for logic-based applications."

It is a fundamental technique in propositional and predicate logic.\n\nThe resolution rule is applied to two clauses that contain complementary literals, i.e., a literal and its negation. When these two clauses are found, the resolution rule allows the derivation of a new clause that includes all the literals of the original clauses except for the complementary pair. This new clause is called the resolvent, and it must logically follow from the original pair of clauses. In predicate logic, this process additionally involves unification, where variables are systematically substituted to match the predicates before resolving.\n\nTo perform resolution in predicate logic:\n1. **Convert all statements into Skolem normal form**: This includes removing implications, moving to negation normal form (where negations only appear directly before predicates), then existential quantifiers are replaced by Skolem functions (if necessary), ensuring all variables are universally quantified.\n\n2. **Apply the resolution rule**: This is done by finding pairs of clauses that contain complementary predicates (i.e., a predicate and its negation), and unifying them if necessary. The unification process is necessary for dealing with variables and is a way to standardize variables across the predicates so they can be eliminated.\n\n3. **Generate the resolvent**: By removing the unified complementary predicates from the clauses and combining the remaining parts.\n\n4. **Repeat the resolution**: The process of applying the resolution rule is iterated with the newly formed resolvents, alongside the existing clauses until either a contradiction is found (an empty clause is derived), or no more resolutions can be performed.\n\n**Example**:\nSuppose we have the following two clauses in a predicate logic system:\n\n1. \u2200x (P(x) \u2228 Q(x))\n2. \u00acP(a) \u2227 \u00acQ(b)\n\nFirst, we convert these into an appropriate form for resolution:\n- Clause 1: P(x) \u2228 Q(x) (assuming universal quantification can be dropped for the sake of resolution)\n- Clause 2: \u00acP(a), \u00acQ(b) (separated into two clauses for individual predicates)\n\nAttempting a resolution between \"P(x) \u2228 Q(x)\" and \"\u00acP(a)\":\n- The predicate P(x) matches \u00acP(a) by substituing x with a: Unify x = a\n- The resolvent of these two clauses, eliminating P, is Q(a)\n\nNo further resolution with P and \u00acP can occur, so let's attempt to resolve Q(a) derived above with \u00acQ(b):\n- Unification fails because a cannot be matched with b (if no function or constant can equate a and b), no further progress can be made with this example.\n\nIf this were an actual resolution proof, additional steps or different clauses might allow continued progress, aiming to resolve to an empty clause indicating a contradiction, thereby supporting the validity of the argument.\n\nIn summary, resolution in predicate if logic involves repeatedly applying the resolution rule, focusing on eliminating complementary pairs of literals (through unification) to derive new clauses, thereby either proving a theorem (by deriving an empty clause) or showing insufficiency in the argument set (unable to proceed to an empty clause)."

Here are some of the key challenges and limitations:\n\n1. **Undecidability and Incompleteness**: Predicate logic, or first-order logic, is subject to G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems and suffers from undecidability in general. G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems imply that there are true statements in sufficiently strong logical systems (like Peano arithmetic) that cannot be proven within the system. Additionally, the decision problem for general predicate logic (whether a given statement is valid) is undecidable, which means that no algorithm can determine the truth of every statement in the language.\n\n2. **Complexity**: First-order logic is semi-decidable or recursively enumerable, meaning that there is an algorithm that will eventually confirm a statement's validity if it is indeed valid, but no such guarantee exists for invalid statements. For any particular set of axioms and a statement, proving or disproving the statement can range from tractable to extraordinarily complex, depending on the structure of the axioms and the statement itself.\n\n3. **Scalability Issues**: As systems and theories grow in complexity, the computational resources required to perform automated theorem proving (e.g., memory and processing power) increase often exponentially. This can limit the practical use of automated theorem proving in larger or more complex domains.\n\n4. **Algorithm Limitations**: Automated theorem proving algorithms, such as resolution, tableau, or others based on logical inference rules, have limitations in terms of the kinds of inferences they are most suited to and the efficiency with which they can process information. These limitations can make it difficult to apply a single theorem prover universally across different kinds of problems.\n\n5. **Human Intuition and Creativity**: Many mathematical proofs require high levels of creativity and intuition, which are challenging to replicate with automated systems. Human mathematicians often rely on deep insights, pattern recognition, or conceptual leaps that automated systems may not be currently capable of making.\n\n6. **Expressiveness of Predicate Logic**: While predicate logic is a powerful language, its expressiveness can sometimes be a limitation in capturing knowledge or reasoning processes that go beyond what can be symbolically represented. Natural language, spatial intuition, and other forms of knowledge representation might not be adequately captured.\n\n7. **Error Handling and Verification**: Automated theorem provers can sometimes produce errors or misleading results if not properly verified. The verification of the software itself and the proofs it generates can be as challenging as solving the original problem.\n\nIn addressing these challenges, advances in computational logic, algorithm design, and technology continue to expand the capabilities and applications of automated theorem proving. Cross-disciplinary approaches, incorporating insights from computer science, mathematics, and even cognitive science, are being explored to overcome some of the inherent limitations and improve the functionality and reliability of these systems."

Modals express modes of truth, such as necessity and possibility, which are beyond the true/false valuation in classical logic. In modal logic, these are represented by the operators \u25c7 (possibly) and \u25a1 (necessarily).\n\n**Modal Logic Basics:**\nIn terms of syntax, modal logic adds these modal operators to the language of propositional logic. Semantically, it involves possible world semantics. Each possible world can be seen as a complete description of a way the world might be. A statement with the modal operator \u25a1 is true in a world if it is true in all possible worlds accessible from that world; conversely, a statement with \u25c7 is true in a world if there is at least one accessible world where the statement is true.\n\n**Reasoning About Knowledge and Belief:**\nModal logic becomes particularly useful in epistemic (knowledge) and doxastic (belief) contexts. \n\n1. **Epistemic Logic:**\n   In epistic logic, the operator K is used to denote knowledge. For example, Kp can be interpreted as \"it is known that p\". The axioms and rules of inference in epistemic logic reflect properties of knowledge, such as:\n   - **Truth:** If something is known, then it is true (Kp \u2192 p).\n   - **Knowledge Closure:** If it is known that p, and it is known that p implies q, then q is also known (Kp & K(p \u2192 q) \u2192 Kq).\n\n   Epistemic logic allows for reasoning about what different agents know, both individually and collectively, and how new knowledge can be deduced from known facts.\n\n2. **Doxastic Logic:**\n   Similarly, doxastic logic deals with beliefs. Using B to denote belief, Bp translates to \"it is believed that p\". Unlike knowledge, belief may not necessarily be true. Also, doxastic logic addresses how beliefs might change in response to new information and how beliefs can be inconsistent or incorrect.\n\n**Applications:**\n- **Artificial Intelligence**: Understanding and modeling how machines can learn knowledge and adapt their belief systems.\n- **Computer Science**: Especially in multi-agent systems where various agents might possess different pieces of information or beliefs that affect their interactions.\n- **Philosophy**: Examining the nature of knowledge and belief, and understanding epistemological questions and theories.\n- **Linguistics**: Analyzing how modal expressions such as possibility and necessity are used in language.\n\nIn summary, modal logic extends traditional logical frameworks to include modalities of necessity and possibility, thereby providing powerful tools for formal reasoning in contexts involving variability of truth according to different possibilities or worlds. It's especially pertinent in fields that involve reasoning about knowledge states and belief systems, offering a structured way to handle information diversity and dynamic information updates."

The vertices are:\n1. \\( (x = 0, y = 33.33) \\) - All material for B.\n   \\[ \\text{Profit} = 0 \\times 10 + 33.33 \\times 15 = 499.95 \\]\n2. \\( (x = 50, y = 0) \\) - All material for A.\n   \\[ \\text{Profit} = 50 \\times 10 + 0 \\times 15 = 500 \\]\n3. Intersection of \\( 2x + 3y = 100 \\) with either axis is already taken as previous points, yet check if a better point exists by solving:\n\\[ 2x + 3y = 100 \\]\n   This needs to be combined with evaluating profit.\n\nMaximizing profit:\n\\[ \\text{Profit at } (x=50, y=0) = 500 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Profit at } (x=0, y=33.33) = 499.95 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Profit at other point needs to be checked if it makes integer solutions.} \\]\n\nSince \\( y = \\frac{100 - 2x}{3} \\), we check validity by putting integers:\nFor \\( x = 16, y = \\frac{100 - 2 \\times 16}{3} = 22.67 \\)\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 16 \\times 10 + 22.67 \\times 15 = 160 + 340.05 = 500.05 \\] approx.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the company can maximize profit slightly by producing 16 units of product A and approx 22 units of product B (22 might be adjusted slightly depending on the need for integer solutions). The result shows the maximum profit is around $500, given the constraints and the types of calculations.\n\nNote: Exact values could depend slightly on rounding and specific integer requirements that production might pose. For practical implementation, integer solutions should be used (e.g., \\( x = 16, y = 22 \\))."
