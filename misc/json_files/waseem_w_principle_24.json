The downside is their limitation in detailing soft tissues and the exposure to ionizing radiation, though minimal.\n\n2. CT Scans (Computed Tomography): CT scans offer detailed cross-sectional images of soft tissues, blood vessels, and bones using X-rays from different angles. This provides a more comprehensive view compared to simple X-rays and is particularly useful in diagnosing internal injuries and bleeding. However, like X-rays, CT scans expose patients to radiation, which might be a concern, especially in frequent monitoring.\n\n3. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging): Utilizing strong magnetic fields and radio waves, MRI scans produce highly detailed images of organs and tissues. This method is excellent for revealing problems in soft tissues that are not visible with X-rays or CT scans. It involves no radiation exposure, making it safer for repeated use. However, MRIs are more expensive and take longer than other imaging tests and can be uncomfortable for claustrophobic patients.\n\n4. Ultrasound: This modality uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of the inside of the body and is commonly used during pregnancy to monitor the fetus.
