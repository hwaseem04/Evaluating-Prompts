This period, named after the pollen of the Dryas octopetala flower which marked the cold conditions in Europe, interrupted the general warming trend at the end of the Pleistocene epoch. The onset of colder temperatures and drier conditions forced human groups to adapt their subsistence strategies, often leading to the development of more complex social structures and innovations in tool and shelter design as resources became more scarce. In terms of megafauna, the Younger Dryas is associated with widespread extinctions, notably in North America where large animals such as mammoths and mastodons vanished. While climate change played a significant role, the presence and hunting practices of humans likely exacerbated these extinctions. The combined stressors of rapid environmental shifts and increased hunting pressures likely pushed many of these large species beyond the brink, reshaping ecosystems profoundly.

FIFO assumes that the oldest products in a company's inventory have been sold first and values the remaining inventory based on the costs of the most recently purchased items, which can increase the inventory value on the balance sheet during periods of inflation. LIFO assumes that the most recently purchased items are sold first, often leading to lower reported net income and lower inventory values on the balance sheet during inflationary periods, as it matches higher recent costs against current revenues. The Weighted Average Cost method smooths out price fluctuations by averaging the cost of inventory items, leading to a moderate impact on the financial statements.

The next step involves adjusting for changes in the working capital accounts on the balance sheet, which include accounts such as accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and accrued expenses. Increases in current asset accounts are subtracted from net income, and increases in current liability accounts are added, reflecting the cash impact of these changes. Finally, cash flows from investing activities and financing activities are accounted for by adding or subtracting cash spent on investments, proceeds from the sale of assets, cash received from issuing stock or debt, and cash used to repay debts or buy back stock.

For example, if a car has a design defect that makes it prone to flipping over while turning, and the manufacturer ignored or did not seek out test results showing this risk, the manufacturer could be liable for negligence if consumers are injured in rollover accidents. \n\nStrict liability, on the other hand, does not require proof of carelessness or fault. In strict liability cases, a manufacturer or seller is liable for any injuries caused by a defective product, regardless of the level of care they exercised. For example, if a toaster is sold with faulty wiring that was not detected during production and later causes a house fire, the manufacturer could be held strictly liable for the damages.

This period included the controversial invasion of Iraq in 2003, justified by the Bush administration primarily under the incorrect belief that Saddam Hussein was harboring weapons of mass destruction. The invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq had long-lasting impacts, destabilizing the region and setting the stage for sectarian conflict. The US policy saw another shift during the Arab Spring in 2011, a series of popular uprisings across the Arab world. While the US supported some movements that aligned with its values of democratic expansion, like in Libya and Egypt, it was cautious in more complex situations such as Syria and Bahrain, often balancing between strategic interests and democratic principles. The rise of ISIS in 2014 in Iraq and Syria posed a new threat, leading to a coalition led by the US to conduct extensive military interventions to dismantle the caliphate declared by the group.

The concept of a just war originates from the idea that war, while terrible, can sometimes be necessary to achieve greater good, correct a grave injustice, or protect innocent lives from imminent threat. However, determining the morality of going to war requires careful consideration of both the intentions behind the war and the means by which the war is conducted. The principles of just war theory, including just cause, right intention, last resort, and proportionality, aim to ensure that war is morally justifiable. Yet, even when these conditions are met, the reality of war often involves significant human suffering, loss of life, and destruction of communities, which can deeply complicate the moral calculus.
